This (Firefox, Chromium/Chrome and Thunderbird) add-on (WebExtension) gives you a modern emoji picker that you can use to find and select emojis (i.e. the emoticons/smileys you know from messengers such as 😃, 😎 or 🤪). It will be directly copied to your clipboard and/or inserted into the active input on the page, when you choose it.

You can then use the emojis on almost any web page, including your favorite messenger (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Threema, Signal, Wire etc.), social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Mastodon etc.) and even e-mails.

It will remember your recently used emojis across sites, and may often be faster than the emoji picker on the site itself.

It uses up-to-date Emojis and lets you access your Emojis in different styles you know from different devices and applications. Here is a list of styles, it supports:

* Apple emojis
* Google emojis
* Twitter emojis ([Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/))
* Facebook emojis
* or just what your system/browser offers (e.g. on Windows thus Windows emojis will be used)

It is based on the awesome [emoji-mart](https://missive.github.io/emoji-mart/). You can test many features there already, before installing it.

This extension works with Firefox v74 or higher, Chromium/Chrome and Thunderbird v91 or higher.

The development of this add-on was also triggered, because the development of another add-on called [“Emoji Helper” or “Emoji Cheatsheet” stalled](https://github.com/johannhof/emoji-helper/issues/127).
