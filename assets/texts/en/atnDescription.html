This add-on provides you with a modern emoji picker that you can use to find and select emojis (i.e. the emoticons/smileys you know from messengers). You can <b>copy them into your clipboard</b> or <b>insert them</b> into the active e-mail.
It uses up-to-date Emojis and lets you access your Emojis in different styles you know from different devices and applications.


<b>Simple & effective!</b>

You can then use the emojis on any e-mail.

It will remember your <b>recently used emojis</b> across e-mails.

It is based on the awesome project <a href="https://missiveapp.com/open/emoji-mart">emoji-mart</a>. You can test many features on the website there already, without installing it.
This extension only works with Firefox and Thunderbird v125 or higher.

It has an effective built-in search, so you can use it as an “emoji cheat sheet”. <b>Find exactly the emoji</b> you wanted to find with your search term!


<b>Choose the Emoji style you want!</b>
